# aodh API WSGI Pipeline
# Define the filters that make up the pipeline for processing WSGI requests
# Note: This pipeline is PasteDeploy's term rather than aodh's pipeline
# used for processing samples
#
# This is the gabbi paste file, which creates the full pipeline without the
# auth middleware.

# Remove authtoken from the pipeline if you don't want to use keystone authentication
