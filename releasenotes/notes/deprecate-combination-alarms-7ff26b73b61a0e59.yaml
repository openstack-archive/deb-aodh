deprecations:
  - The combination alarms are officially deprecated and disabled by default.
    Set api.enable_combination_alarms to True to enable them.
    Existing alarms will still be evaluated, but access to them via the API is
    linked to whether that configuration option is turned on or off.
    It's advised to use composite alarms instead.
